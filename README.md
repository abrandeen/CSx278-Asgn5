# Vanderbilt Campus Dining Lines

In this project, I sought to make a texting application that would inform students about campus dining lines. 
To find out the users' needs, I interviewed three students on their opinions about campus dining lines. Overall, the users 
felt that campus dining lines were consistently long at certain times, but it was hard to know which one was longest. Also, 
when walking from far away, students would like to know the length of the line. While they sited their distaste for waiting 
in long line, they all have to eat lunch in a certain period before classes and must eat on campus as its on the meal plan 
paid for by parents.

Consuqeuntly, I will create a texting application that will let students know the length of campus dining lines. This
application should respond to students questions about the shortest line in a certain area, the length of a certain line, and
the lines under a given length. The length of a line will described by the time it takes to go through the entire line and recieve
food, not the amount of people in line.

The wait time for a line will be calculated by multiplying the number of people in line by the average amount of time it
takes for one person to go through the line. While the final application would detect the number of people in line using cameras 
placed in dining halls, the prototype will rely on crowdsourcing (i.e. users or Vanderbilt staff will text in the number of people
in each line to the application). Additionally, the prototype will only report on a few dining halls.

# Answers:

## Question 1: 
  * A. 15 minutes for lunch and dinner depends on the place. If I'm going to grins, probably also 10-15 minutes.
  * B. 1.5 minutes for lunch and 3 minutes for dinner
  * C. 20 minutes at lunch and 10 at dinner.

## Question 2:
  *A. Typically, I'll eat lunch and dinner because I don't have time in the morning to eat breakfast. I'm usually in a rush in the
     morning and eat a smaller breakfast so don't feel like I need to waste a whole meal swipe on breakfast. I usually eat grins
     because its healthyish, pub because it has a central location, and EBI because the line moves fast.
  *B. Lunch because its the most convient during the day. I usually eat Ranwhiches.
  *C. I eat bowls for lunch and Kissam for dinner because they're healthy options. I don't eat breakfast because I don't want to 
     pay for a full meal for breakfast.

## Question 3: 
  *A. Kind of, right at the peak times I try to avoid them, but in between classes its usually shorter. Grins is very unpredictable 
     though.
  *B. Yes, they're pretty long when clas lets out and at peak dinner hours.
  *C. No, the lines are always long at certain times, but I never know which will take the longest.

## Question 4:
  *A. I would go to ones that are shorter. I really hate waiting in lines. Sometimes during lunch I just go to Food for Thought just 
     so I don't wait in a long line.
  *B. If I knew the line was long, I wouldn't go to it.
  *C. I'll wait to eat lunch.

## Question 5: 
  *A. I don't wait in lines becayse I'm impatient and usually in a hurry. If I'm eating with people and they're in a shorter line, I 
     go to shorter lines because I want to sit and eat with them.
  *B. I don't wait in long lines because I don't think the food is good enough to wait for.
  *C. I don't wait in lines because I have to get to class. 

## Question 6:
  *A. Grins, Kissam, and Rand bowls. I would also like to know when Grins is closed.
  *B. Kissam because its a long walk and I don't want to have to wait once I get there.
  *C. Grins, Rand bowls, and pub because they're the best food on campus.

## Question 7: 
  *A. My parents pay for it and for the most part its pretty good and there are lots of options. Its also easier than going off campus 
     or cooking.
  *B. Because they're cheap and on the meal plan.
  *C. Because we have to live on campus.

## Question 8:
  *A. If I'm going to Rand, then I will max wait in one line. I'll get other things that don't require waiting in line like fruit.
  *B. On average, 1.5 lines
  *C. I usually wait in about 2 lines.

## Question 9: 
  *A. I refuse to go to Grins if the line is super long. Even if walk there, and its pretty out of the way, if the line is too long, 
     I'll go somewhere else. If I have a friend with me that I can talk with, sometimes I'll wait in long lines. If Rand is really 
     crowded, I'll just go somewhere else like food for thought. I also get very annoyed by cutters.
  *B. I eat off campus if the lines are too long.
  *C. I don't stand in the line if its too long.

## Question 10:
  *A. Anything over 20 minutes. Sometimes 15 depending on the day.
  *B. 13 minutes is when it becomes too long
  *C. 20 minutes is when it becomes too long

## Question 11: 
  *A. Depends on the time I have. I'll go somewhere with a longer line when my day is less busy. If its a day where I really need to 
     study, I'll go to a grab-and-go place.
  *B. Quality of food and length of the line
  *C. Based on whether the food is healthy. The pasta line is always short, but I can't eat pasta for lunch every day.

## Question 12:
  A. Everyone gets out of class at the same time and tries to go then. Also, the nature of a lot of the food is that the people make 
     it as we're in line so that takes longer. Dining is overcrowded and we need more food options.
  B. Because everyone eats at the same time.
  C. Because Rand is the only good place to eat for lunch.

## Question 13:
  A. Depends on who pre-prepared the line is. Also, pub and grins they just take your order, but bowls and randwhich they make the 
     food as you're in line.
  B. Faster at lunch. Randwhich line flies because of expierenced staff.
  C. The Kissam moves really fast because there are a lot people working there. The lines where you can customize your food takes a 
     lot longer. The Mongolian beef line takes forever, but is really good.

## Question 14:
  A. Munchie mart or 2301 because I don't think the food is very good.
  B. I don't go to 2301, even though the line is short, because I have no idea what they serve. I don't eat rabbit food.
  C. I don't like the pasta place, even though the line is short because its unhealthy. Or the bah mi line because the sandwhiches 
     all have mustard and pickles on them and I don't like them.

## Question 15:
  A. Wait time because the same length line takes a very different amount of time at different places.
  B. Wait time because it means more to me.
  C. Wait time because some lines move faster than others so knowing the number of people is not as helpful.
