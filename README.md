# Vanderbilt Campus Dining Lines

In this project, I sought to make a texting application that would inform students about campus dining lines. 
To find out the users' needs, I interviewed three students on their opinions about campus dining lines. Overall, the users 
felt that campus dining lines were consistently long at certain times, but it was hard to know which one was longest. Also, 
when walking from far away, students would like to know the length of the line. While they sited their distaste for waiting 
in long line, they all have to eat lunch in a certain period before classes and must eat on campus as its on the meal plan 
paid for by parents.

Consuqeuntly, I will create a texting application that will let students know the length of campus dining lines. This
application should respond to students questions about the shortest line in a certain area, the length of a certain line, and
the lines under a given length. The length of a line will described by the time it takes to go through the entire line and recieve
food, not the amount of people in line.

The wait time for a line will be calculated by multiplying the number of people in line by the average amount of time it
takes for one person to go through the line. While the final application would detect the number of people in line using cameras 
placed in dining halls, the prototype will rely on crowdsourcing (i.e. users or Vanderbilt staff will text in the number of people
in each line to the application). Additionally, the prototype will only report on a few dining halls.

# Answers:

## Question 1: 
  * A. 15 minutes for lunch and dinner depends on the place. If I'm going to grins, probably also 10-15 minutes.
  * B. 1.5 minutes for lunch and 3 minutes for dinner
  * C. 20 minutes at lunch and 10 at dinner.

## Question 2:
  * A. Typically, I'll eat lunch and dinner because I don't have time in the morning to eat breakfast. I'm usually in a rush in the
     morning and eat a smaller breakfast so don't feel like I need to waste a whole meal swipe on breakfast. I usually eat grins
     because its healthyish, pub because it has a central location, and EBI because the line moves fast.
  * B. Lunch because its the most convient during the day. I usually eat Ranwhiches.
  * C. I eat bowls for lunch and Kissam for dinner because they're healthy options. I don't eat breakfast because I don't want to 
     pay for a full meal for breakfast.

## Question 3: 
  * A. Kind of, right at the peak times I try to avoid them, but in between classes its usually shorter. Grins is very unpredictable 
     though.
  * B. Yes, they're pretty long when class lets out and at peak dinner hours.
  * C. No, the lines are always long at certain times, but I never know which will take the longest.

## Question 4:
  * A. I would go to ones that are shorter. I really hate waiting in lines. Sometimes during lunch I just go to Food for Thought just 
     so I don't wait in a long line.
  * B. If I knew the line was long, I wouldn't go to it.
  * C. I'll wait to eat lunch.

## Question 5: 
  * A. I don't wait in lines because I'm impatient and usually in a hurry. If I'm eating with people and they're in a shorter line, I 
     go to shorter lines because I want to sit and eat with them.
  * B. I don't wait in long lines because I don't think the food is good enough to wait for.
  * C. I don't wait in lines because I have to get to class. 

## Question 6:
  * A. Grins, Kissam, and Rand bowls. I would also like to know when Grins is closed.
  * B. Kissam because its a long walk and I don't want to have to wait once I get there.
  * C. Grins, Rand bowls, and pub because they're the best food on campus.

## Question 7: 
  * A. My parents pay for it and for the most part its pretty good and there are lots of options. Its also easier than going off campus 
     or cooking.
  * B. Because they're cheap and on the meal plan.
  * C. Because we have to live on campus.

## Question 8:
  * A. If I'm going to Rand, then I will max wait in one line. I'll get other things that don't require waiting in line like fruit.
  * B. On average, 1.5 lines
  * C. I usually wait in about 2 lines.

## Question 9: 
  * A. I refuse to go to Grins if the line is super long. Even if walk there, and its pretty out of the way, if the line is too long, 
     I'll go somewhere else. If I have a friend with me that I can talk with, sometimes I'll wait in long lines. If Rand is really 
     crowded, I'll just go somewhere else like food for thought. I also get very annoyed by cutters.
  * B. I eat off campus if the lines are too long.
  * C. I don't stand in the line if its too long.

## Question 10:
  * A. Anything over 20 minutes. Sometimes 15 depending on the day.
  * B. 13 minutes is when it becomes too long
  * C. 20 minutes is when it becomes too long

## Question 11: 
  * A. Depends on the time I have. I'll go somewhere with a longer line when my day is less busy. If its a day where I really need to 
     study, I'll go to a grab-and-go place.
  * B. Quality of food and length of the line
  * C. Based on whether the food is healthy. The pasta line is always short, but I can't eat pasta for lunch every day.

## Question 12:
  * A. Everyone gets out of class at the same time and tries to go then. Also, the nature of a lot of the food is that the people make 
     it as we're in line so that takes longer. Dining is overcrowded and we need more food options.
  * B. Because everyone eats at the same time.
  * C. Because Rand is the only good place to eat for lunch.

## Question 13:
  * A. Depends on who pre-prepared the line is. Also, pub and grins they just take your order, but bowls and randwhich they make the 
     food as you're in line.
  * B. Faster at lunch. Randwhich line flies because of expierenced staff.
  * C. The Kissam moves really fast because there are a lot people working there. The lines where you can customize your food takes a 
     lot longer. The Mongolian beef line takes forever, but is really good.

## Question 14:
  * A. Munchie mart or 2301 because I don't think the food is very good.
  * B. I don't go to 2301, even though the line is short, because I have no idea what they serve. I don't eat rabbit food.
  * C. I don't like the pasta place, even though the line is short because its unhealthy. Or the bah mi line because the sandwhiches 
     all have mustard and pickles on them and I don't like them.

## Question 15:
  * A. Wait time because the same length line takes a very different amount of time at different places.
  * B. Wait time because it means more to me.
  * C. Wait time because some lines move faster than others so knowing the number of people is not as helpful.

# Development Approach
## 1. Requirements Gathering
After selecting the topic of Vanderbilt Campus dining lines, I created 15 questions to capture users motivations, frustrations, and needs surrounding this topic. Using these questions, I interviewed three users from my target user group (Vanderbilt students who eat meals on campus) and recorded their responses. This interview process is essential to empathize with the user, start to understand what the users actually want in an application, and confirm assumptions. If these key topics are not understood, the developers are at a great risk of building the wrong thing. While software may function "correctly," its of no use to the user if they don't actually want, need, or like to use it. Next, I compiled the comments from interviews into a categorized list so I could clearly skim over all the users comments and convert them into formal requirements.

## 2. Design
To design the application, I will start with the design of the experts texting application and adapt it to meet the Vanderbilt dining lines requirements. I will use the same pattern of returning actions to be taken as a list instead of invoking them directly from the function. This pattern limits the number of side effects functions have and makes them more modular and easier to test. Following the pattern from the experts application, I will create one major function for each question the app should respond to. I will fully describe each of these functions expected inputs and outputs and how to deal with unexpected input and edge cases.

Additionally, I will continue using a map as the appliation state, but will design a new data model for this map to meet the storage needs of this applications.

I will also design new tests cases for this application by adapting tests from the experts application. Writing tests before development helps tests to be independent of my implementation of the methods. These tests will also ensure the application is sustainable as any future changes or additional features should also pass these tests.

## 3. Implementation
I will utilize an Agile approach to developing this application, implementing each type of question (a "feature") the application should respond to in a different sprint. After each sprint, I will have a new icremental working version of the application that is able to be tested. This incremental testing ensures that the current version of the application is never far from the last working version. The waterfall approach takes the risk of developing all the features at once, the application not functioning correctly, and the developers having little idea where the errors are occuring. With this Agile implementation, if an error occurs, it must be in the most recent feature/sprint as the last sprint produced a functional application.

## 4. Testing
To ensure the application is built correctly, both in design and execution, I will conduct tests within the code and user testing. The code tests will be adapted from the previous application to ensure all expected and edge cases for each question are handled, as well as the case where a user sends a text in an invalid format. Specifically, it will ensure the correct actions are being returned from the functions and the correct string is being returned. This testing will ensure the app is built "right."

Equally important, I will conduct incremental user testing in between sprints to get users' feedback on the application. Users will be asked to use the application and give their thoughts throughout the process. They will also be asked about ease of use, design, etc. Their responses will be taken into account and the design will be adapted as neccessary for the next sprint. Getting feedback early in the development process is imperative as it is much less costly to make changes now than later. This testing will ensure the "right" app is built.
